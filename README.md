# Simple-30XX-Save-Editor
Basic save editor for 30XX. You can use it to edit Memoria, Titan Shards, the five items in the smuggler's shop and your entropy clear level. 

The game's main save file "30XXv002.sav" is located in Documents/30XX. The editor should open this directory by default. Use at your own risk (you should back the file up before editing).

If you encounter any issues please let me know in the 30XX Discord, as I don't really check Github.
